Girls In Hawaii
Not Dead

Broken branches in two
under my shoes
Everything's tied to gravity
I walk alone to a sunday dawn

So can you tell them i'm broke
Never on top
Every day reality shouts
I'm about to let it down

Not dead i'm not dead
I'm not dead, i'm not dead
I'm not dead, i'm not dead
I'm just doing wrong

I am strongly upset
Down on my knees
Left in here caught in the undertow
Please turn me off or wake me up

Nothing left in this box
Memories lost
Pieces of what i try to keep
They leak out of my head... And gets me down

Until i sleep
I'll forever walk
