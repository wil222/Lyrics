Ella Fitzgerald
Cry Me A River
English
Now you say you're lonely
You cried the long night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me, out of my head
While you never shed a tear?
Remember, I remember, all that you said?
You told me love was too plebian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say you love me
and just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river...over you...
