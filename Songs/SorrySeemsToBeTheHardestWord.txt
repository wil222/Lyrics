What I got to do to make you love me?
What I got to do to make you care?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
And I wake to find that you're not there?

What I got to do to make you want me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when its all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

It's sad, so sad
It's a sad, sad situation
And it's getting more and more absurd
It's so sad so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh it seems to me
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

What I do to make you want me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I say when it's all over?
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

(Elton John)
It's sad, so sad
It's a sad sad situation
And it's gotten more and more absurd
It's sad, so sad
Why can't we talk it over?
Oh it seems to me
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

What do I do to make you love me?
What I got to do to be heard?
What do I do when lightning strikes me?
Yeah.....What do I got to do?
What do I got to do?
When sorry seems to be the hardest word
