I want a girl with a mind like a diamond
I want a girl who knows what's best
I want a girl with shoes that cut
And eyes that burn like cigarettes

I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She is playing with her jewelry, she is putting up her hair
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket

I want a girl who gets up early
(Gets up early)
I want a girl who stays up late
(Stays up late)
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
(Uninterrupted)
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape

With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket

I want a girl with a smooth liquidation
(Smooth liquidation)
I want a girl with good dividends
(Good dividends)
At City Bank we will meet accidentally
(Meet accidentally)
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen

She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She is changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She is trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket
