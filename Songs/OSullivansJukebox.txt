Well I've been around the block let me tell you
Hell my hair is all turning to grey
Everything aches juste a little bit more
That it ever did back in the days

Now I don't  ??? high across circles
I dont' drive some big fancy car
As I put most of my money in O'Sullivan's Jukebox
And the rest went behind the bar

At school I was a fine mathematician
A precocious and a scholarly kid
But I gave it all that for that sweet flowing cup
And I'm glad every day that I did

And they told me that I could have been anything
They said I was gonna go far
And still I put most of my money in O'Sullivan's Jukebox
And the rest went behind the bar

I was always pretty handy with a football
Could have been a rock of the England back forth
Or maybe a Hollywood actor
What the hell that I want all that for

And I could play the guitar like a son of a bitch
I could have been a rock and roll star
Still I put most of my money in O'Sullivan's Jukebox
And the rest went behind the bar

Could have got me a job in the city
I could have managed financial affairs
And gamble away the money of strangers
Well I could live like a millionaire

See I always made friends better than ever make profit
???
I invested most of my money in O'Sullivan's Jukebox
And his hedge fund behind the bar

To hear the bells that toll and last tolling
Guess all of things must come to an end
If you would ever drink with me brother
Well you'll never have one ??? friend

And when they'll carry me away in a coffin
Won't you light up a cuban cigar
And raise up your glass with that sweet drunken arse
??? O'Sullivan's bar

And raise up your glass with that sweet drunken arse
??? O'Sullivan's bar
